Long ago, in England, there was a place called Sherwood Forest where Robin Hood lived. He was a smart young man who knew several card tricks and was skilled in archery. When Robin was a young child, he was cheated a lot by noblemen, and since then, he decided to do good for the poor people by robbing the rich.

The Sheriff of Nottingham was very angry with Robin Hood and had placed many rewards for whoever caught him. However, Robin Hood had many friends in Sherwood Forest and in Nottingham who made him their leader. They served him by acting as his loyal informers. Whenever the Sheriff planned to catch Robin, his informers would let Robin Hood know everything. That is why the Sheriff could not catch him, and the rich people were scared of going through the Sherwood Forest. They knew Robin Hood would attack and loot all their money and things if they went through the forest.
